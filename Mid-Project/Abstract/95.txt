As an underlying support technology, blockchain is a shared ledger system and a computational paradigm, which is decentralized, and it is highly compatible with the distributed economic system. The distributed scheduling model of agricultural business resources based on the public service platform is a comprehensive solution to the current situation of agricultural industry which is ”scattered, small, disorderly and weak”, and plays an important role in integrating decentralized resource and making on-demand scheduling. Aiming at some key problems in the current Chinese public service platform, this paper proposes a public blockchain of agricultural supply chain system based on double chain architecture, mainly studying the dual chain structure and its storage mode, resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm. The results show that the chain of agricultural supply chain based on double chain structure can take into account the openness and security of transaction information and the privacy of enterprise information, can self-adaptively complete rent-seeking and matching of resources, and greatly enhance the credibility of the public service platform and the overall efficiency of the system.
