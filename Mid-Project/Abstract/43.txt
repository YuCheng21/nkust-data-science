With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data technologies have emerged as a critical data analytics tool to bring the knowledge within IoT infrastructures to better meet the purpose of the IoT systems and support critical decision making. Although the topic of Big Data analytics itself is extensively researched, the disparity between IoT domains (such as healthcare, energy, transportation and others) has isolated the evolution of Big Data approaches in each IoT domain. Thus, the mutual understanding across IoT domains can possibly advance the evolution of Big Data research in IoT.

In this work, we therefore conduct a survey on Big Data technologies in different IoT domains to facilitate and stimulate knowledge sharing across the IoT domains. Based on our review, this paper discusses the similarities and differences among Big Data technologies used in different IoT domains, suggests how certain Big Data technology used in one IoT domain can be re-used in another IoT domain, and develops a conceptual framework to outline the critical Big Data technologies across all the reviewed IoT domains.
