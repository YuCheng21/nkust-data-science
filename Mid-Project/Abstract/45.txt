Advanced manufacturing is one of the core national strategies in the US (AMP), Germany (Industry 4.0) and China (Made-in China 2025). The emergence of the concept of Cyber Physical System (CPS) and big data imperatively enable manufacturing to become smarter and more competitive among nations. Many researchers have proposed new solutions with big data enabling tools for manufacturing applications in three directions: product, production and business. Big data has been a fast-changing research area with many new opportunities for applications in manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of big data in manufacturing. Six key drivers of big data applications in manufacturing have been identified. The key drivers are system integration, data, prediction, sustainability, resource sharing and hardware. Based on the requirements of manufacturing, nine essential components of big data ecosystem are captured. They are data ingestion, storage, computing, analytics, visualization, management, workflow, infrastructure and security. Several research domains are identified that are driven by available capabilities of big data ecosystem. Five future directions of big data applications in manufacturing are presented from modelling and simulation to real-time big data analytics and cybersecurity.
