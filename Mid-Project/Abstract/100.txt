Cloud computing offers an innovative method of delivering IT services efficiently. Extant literature suggests that cloud technology can enhance the level of services in various industries, including healthcare services. As with any technological innovation, cloud computing should be rigorously evaluated before its widespread adoption. This research study presents a systematic review of scholarly articles of cloud computing in the healthcare sector. We considered 316 articles and filtered down to 88 articles to present a classification framework that has three dimensions: cloud computing-enabled healthcare opportunities, issues, and applications. Implications to future research and practice are highlighted in the areas of value-added healthcare services towards medical decision-making, data security & privacy obligations of cloud service providers, health monitoring features and innovative IT service delivery models using cloud computing.
