We propose a deep learning solution to the problem of object detection in 3D CT images, i.e. the localization and classification of multiple structures. Supervised learning methods require large annotated datasets that are usually difficult to acquire. We thus develop a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) + You Only Look Once (YOLO) combined method for CT data augmentation using MRI source images to train a YOLO detector. This results in a fast and accurate detection with a mean average distance of 7.95 Â± 6.2 mm, which is significantly better than detection without data augmentation. We show that the approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art detection methods for medical images.
