Data collection is required to be safe and efficient considering both data privacy and system performance. In this paper, we study a new problem: distributed data sharing with privacy-preserving requirements. Given a data demander requesting data from multiple distributed data providers, the objective is to enable the data demander to access the distributed data without knowing the privacy of any individual provider. The problem is challenged by two questions: how to transmit the data safely and accurately; and how to efficiently handle data streams? As the first study, we propose a practical method, Shadow Coding, to preserve the privacy in data transmission and ensure the recovery in data collection, which achieves privacy preserving computation in a data-recoverable, efficient, and scalable way. We also provide practical techniques to make Shadow Coding efficient and safe in data streams. Extensive experimental study on a large-scale real-life dataset offers insight into the performance of our schema. The proposed schema is also implemented as a pilot system in a city to collect distributed mobile phone data.
