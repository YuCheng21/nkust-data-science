Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries can reduce the risk of battery failure by predicting the end of life. In this paper, we propose novel RUL prediction techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM). To estimate RUL even in the presence of capacity regeneration phenomenon, we consider multiple measurable data from battery management system such as voltage, current and temperature charging profiles whose patterns vary as aging. Unlike the traditional LSTM prediction that matches input layer with output layer as one-to-one structure, we leverage many-to-one structure to be flexible for various input types and to substantially reduce the number of parameters for better generalization. Using the NASA lithium-ion battery datasets, we verify the accuracy of the proposed LSTM-based RUL prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed single-channel LSTM model improves the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 39.2% compared to the baseline LSTM model. Furthermore, the proposed multi-channel LSTM model significantly improves the MAPE, e.g., by 63.7% compared to the baseline; the proposed model achieves 0.47-1.88% of MAPE while the state-of-the-art baseline LSTM shows 0.6-6.45% of MAPE.
